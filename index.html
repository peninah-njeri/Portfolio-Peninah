            <img class="pesh" src="images/pesh.JPG" height="250" width="200">
            <p>After graduating high school a couple of years ago with a mean grade of B-,i was not not sure of the route to take.
            Fortunately i met a friend of mine who advised me on taking a course in tech,
            as the world is embracing technology at a very high rate.</p>
            
            <p> I persued a diploma in IT at Kcau, and after two years,
             i graduated and i secured myself a job at an It consultancy firm.
             I worked there for a couple of months and later joined another firm working 
             as an administrator on an online management system. It was at that time i developed 
             intrest to learn programming as i was curious to know how the system i was working with was developed.
